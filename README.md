# sigil [![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/danmx/sigil/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/danmx/sigil)

## Description

> *Sigil* is the hub of the Great Wheel, a city at the center of the Outlands, the most balanced of neutral areas at the center of the planes. Also known as the "City of Doors" for the multitude of portals to other planes of existence and the Cage since those portals are the only way in or out, it is the setting for most of Planescape: Torment.

*Sigil* is an AWS SSM Session manager client inspired by [xen0l's aws-gate](https://github.com/xen0l/aws-gate).

## Features

- all-in-one - a single tool to list and connect to the given instance
- configuration file (YAML) support
- lightweight [container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/danmx/sigil) (~16MB)

## Examples

### Usage

Docker:

```console
$ docker run --rm -it -v "${HOME}"/.sigil:/home/.sigil -v "${HOME}"/.aws:/home/.aws danmx/sigil:0.0 list --output-format wide
```

Binary:

```console
$ sigil -r eu-west-1 session --type instance-id --target i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Using with [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault):

```console
$ aws-vault exec AWS_PROFILE -- sigil -r eu-west-1 session --type instance-id --target i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Config file

By default configuration files are stored in `$HOME/.sigil/` and the default config file is `config.yaml`.

```yaml
region: eu-west-1
target: worker-Node
type: name-tag                  # instance-id/priv-dns/name-tag
output-format: wide             # text/json/yaml/wide
```

## Build

### Binaries

To build binaries for all platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows) and Docker image run:

```console
$ make build
```

To run specific build use:

```console
$ make build-[linux|mac|windows]
```

Binaries are located in:

- Linux: `bin/release/linux/amd64/sigil`
- Mac: `bin/release/darwin/amd64/sigil`
- Windows: `bin/release/darwin/amd64/sigil.exe`

### Docker

To only build docker image run:

```console
$ make build-docker
```

It'll create a docker image tagged `sigil:{version}` where `{version}` corresponds to sigil's current version.
